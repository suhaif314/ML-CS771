# DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS METHOD OR ITS INPUT OUTPUT BEHAVIOR

# INPUT CONVENTION
# filenames: a list of strings containing filenames of images

# OUTPUT CONVENTION
# The method must return a list of strings. Make sure each string is either "ODD"
# or "EVEN" (without the quotes) depending on whether the hexadecimal number in
# the image is odd or even. Take care not to make spelling or case mistakes. Make
# sure that the length of the list returned as output is the same as the number of
# filenames that were given as input. The judge may give unexpected results if this
# convention is not followed.
